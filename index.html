      <p>Windows has become more stable, versatile and better in recent years. It still has its flaws and windowsHacks
        helps you to make Windows work for you, to make it
        better.</p>
      <p>Are you switching from macOS to Windows? The <a href="#mac-a-like">Mac-A-Like</a> section has tips on how to
        get useful
        Mac features on Windows.</p>

        alt="windowsHacks icon with a tool to adjust settings">
      <h2>Windows settings: the basics</h2>
      <h3>Display</h3>
      <p>The default setting of Windows tends to display texts, icons and other things quite large. Because of this you
        may see less on the screen then you want. You change this in <span class="explain">&quot;Settings &gt; "System"
          >
          &quot;Display&quot;</span>. With scale and layout you have the option to change both the resolution and the
        size of text and apps. Choose to adjust the latter. The percentage depends on it screen. If the scaling is at
        125% then you can try 100%.</p>
      <h3>Connecting devices</h3>
      <p>You pair a wireless mouse, headset or other device by going to <span class="explain">&quot;Settings&quot; &gt;
          &quot;Devices&quot; &gt; &quot;Bluetooth & other devices&quot;</span>. Make sure bluetooth is enabled on the
        device you want to pair and click &quot;Add bluetooth or other device&quot;.</p>
      <h3>Touchpad</h3>
      <p>MacBooks are known for their very good touchpads and they are still the best. Microsoft saw this too and with
        the addition of Windows Precision Drivers it offers manufacturers the option of adding better touchpads to
        Windows laptops. Manufacturers such as Dell, Razer and of course Microsoft have good touchpads nowadays. You
        also have the option to assign tasks to movements on the touchpad such as scrolling or switching desktop. You
        change this in <span class="explain">&quot;Settings&quot; &gt;
          &quot;Devices&quot; &gt;
          &quot;Touchpad&quot;</span>.</p>
      <h3 id="browser">Browser</h3>
      <p>Windows comes with Microsoft Edge as the default browser. Internet Explorer is also still included, but this is
        so obsolete that you should no longer use it because it doesn't support modern web technologies and many
        websites don't work as they should in Internet Explorer.</p>
      <p>You are free to install other browsers such as Firefox, Google Chrome or Brave. Microsoft released a new
        version of Edge in the short term based on Chromium, the engine behind Chrome. It works works very well, offers
        various privacy options and you can use the Chrome extensions that you are used
        to.</p>

      <a class="download" target="blank" href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge'>Download Edge
        Chromium</a>
      <h3>Default apps</h3>
      <p>Windows offers a lot of freedom when choosing default apps for browser, e-mail and more. Go to
        <span class="explain">&quot;Settings&quot; &gt; &quot;Apps&quot; &gt;
          &quot;Default apps&quot;</span>.
      </p>
      <p>Do you want to change with which program a file type is opened by default? Scroll on the same page to <span
          class="explain">&quot;Choose default apps by file type"</span>.</p>
      <h3>Startup apps</h3>
      <p>Certain programs are started by default when the PC starts up for Windows to function properly. You can add
        more programs that you want to start by default, because you use them often. Think of apps like a password
        manager or an app such as Dropbox for synchronizing files. You select which apps this applies to in <span
          class="explain">&quot;Settings&quot; &gt; &quot;Apps&quot; &gt; &quot;Startup&quot;</span>.</p>
      <h3>Dark Mode</h3>
      <p>Do you want Windows in dark mode, but certain apps like OneNote not? No problem. Many apps offer an option for
        a dark or light mode or for the app to follow the Windows settings. Go to
        <span class="explain">&quot;Settings&quot; &gt; &quot;Personalization&quot; &gt;
          &quot;Colors&quot;</span> and select Dark at &quot;Choose your color&quot;.</p>

      <h3>Free up disk space</h3>
      <p>On both Mac and Windows, it is sometimes a mystery why so much storage is used. Microsoft has created something
        handy that makes it very easy to see which data can be deleted without that you need to be scared that an
        important file is thrown away or that you are breaking something.</p>
      <p>Open <span class="explain">&quot;Settings&quot; &gt; &quot;System&quot; &gt; &quot;Storage&quot; &gt;
          &quot;Configure storage sense or run it now&quot;</span>.
      </p>
      <p>Here you can, for example, set when temporary files are wiped and for which files you want to do that. In
        In overview click on &quot;Temporary files&quot; and a new windows opens with al temporary files that can be
        deleted. Select what you want to delete and Windows will do that. Very convenient. </p>
      <p>You should also check your browser(s) on a regular basis to delete data or let the browser do this in the
        background.</p>
      <h3>Add fonts</h3>
      <p>Microsoft made it very easy to add new fonts to Windows. All you have to is download the font of your choice
        and in Windows you go to <span class="explain">
          &quot;Setting&quot; &gt; &quot;Personalization&quot; &gt; &quot;Fonts&quot;</span> eAnd drag the downloaded
        font here. If you have the font as a ZIP file, you must first unpack it.</p>
      <h3>32-bit</h3>
      <p>Windows, unlike macOS, supports 32-bit applications. Apple did announce a while ago that 32-bit applications
        would no longer work on versions of macOS released as of autumn 2019. You can defend this decision but it is a
        fact that for many people this is very inconvenient. With Windows you are not bothered by this.</p>
      <h3>Gaming</h3>
      <p>If there is one thing that \everyone agrees on then it is that Windows is better t gaming than macOS. There are
        various reasons for that, but it is a fact and that is why there are more games for Windows. Even if you are not
        a hardcore gamer, it is nice that you can play the games that you want on Windows. And with regard to the
        prevision point about 32-bit; many (older) games are all still 32 bit.</p>

      <img src="images/keyboard-shortcuts.svg" class="delay" data-delay=".2s" alt="Keyboard for shortcuts">
      <h1>Keyboard shortcuts</h1>
      <p>Just like macOS, Windows has many keyboard shortcuts that make life easier, making you work faster while being
        less dependent on a mouse. An important difference with macOS is that on macOS CMD is the magic key and on
        Windows that is CRTL and the Windows key. That can be confusing in the beginning, but you get used to it
        quickly.</p>
      <p>There are a lot of keyboard shortcuts, but these are the most useful.</p>

      <h2>Apps</h2>
      <h3>Notes</h3>
      <p>Where you have many good note taking apps for the Mac such as Bear, Apple Notes, Evernote, OneNote and more,
        there are a lot less for Windows. For all-round note apps you have to rely on Evernote and OneNote. On new
        Windows PCs, OneNote is installed by default.</p>
      <p>Just like on macOS, you have Notion on Windows, but that app has the disadvantage that notes are only offline
        available when they have been opened recently. Although it is a good app and NOtion goes beyond a note app. You
        create Kanban boards, to do lists and more. Other apps do this too, but not like Notion.</p>
      <p>Evernote has fallen behind the competition in recent years.They are working on a major update and might bring
        them back to the top. It is still one of the better all-rounders. Do you just want an
        app for taking notes without frills? Then try Simplenote. A good app that does exactly that and it is free.</p>
      <p>Do you like taking notes with a pen and if you have something like a Surface Pro, then you should try Nebo as
        alternative to OneNote. It costs € 9.99 and it is worth every penny. You make handwritten notes and Nebo easily
        converts the note into typed text and it does that almost flawlessly.</p>

      <h3>To Do</h3>
      <p>Many productive people write things down so that they don't forget it and it is out of their head. A to do app
        helps with this. There are many to do apps and Microsoft To Do is among the best. You quickly create new tasks,
        lists and groups with options such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reminders</li>
        <li>Notes</li>
        <li>Attach files</li>
        <li>Sub-tasks</li>
        <li>Share lists</li>
        <li>Assign tasks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Microsoft To Do is versatile with and free. An alternative is Todoist. The basic version of Todoist is free,
        premium starts at € 3 per month. Both apps are available on Windows, macOS, Android, iPhone and iPad.</p>

        Todoist</a>
      <h3>Writing</h3>
      <p>A note app is great for taking notes and writing short pieces of text. Writing apps offer more structure and
        overview when writing texts. Moreover, they use <a
          href='https://doque.nl/blog/slimmer-schrijven-met-markdown/'>Markdown</a> which lets you write faster and with
        less distraction. Are you done with a text then you can export or copy it to Word, PDF, Markdown or HTML. </p>
      <p>Both iA Writer and Typora do an excellent job, with an important difference being that Typora instantly convert
        Markdown texts to rich text.</p>
      <p>Typora is officially still a beta version and currently free. iA Writer costs around € 20 for Windows. If you
        also want to use it mobile on Android or iOS, the app will cost around € 10 there.</p>

      <h3>Netflix</h3>
      <p>Unlike on macOS, you have a separate app for Netflix on Windows. That does not only mean that you can watch
        series and movies, but you can also download them for offline use. And the latter is ideal for vacations where
        you have limited internet access.</p>

        Netflix</a>
      <h3>Pocket Casts</h3>
      <p>If you listen to podcasts, Pocket Casts is the app you need. It's just very good app that available is on iOS,
        Android, macOS, Windows and as a web app. For the last three you need the premium version and that will cost you
        € 0.99 per month. That will sync everything flawlessly with all your devices. Of course you can also use Spotify
        and iTunes for podcasts, but Pocket Cast is doing the job better. Its design is nice and you can continue to
        listen effortlessly on the PC where you stopped on the phone.</p>

      <h3>f.lux</h3>
      <p>Staring at a screen with blue light the whole evening is not the most pleasant thing for your eyes. Windows has
        a built-in solution that adjusts the colors of the screen, but if you don't like it or don't like how it works
        on your PC then there is f.lux. This app goes beyond the built-in solution of Windows, or macOS, and offers you
        options to adjust colors and times to your liking. You can download it for free and try out.
      </p>
      <a class="download" target="blank" href='https://justgetflux.com/'>Download f.lux</a>
      <h3>Photo editing and graphic design</h3>
      <p>Photoshop is the best-known photo editing program, but Adobe subscriptions are too expensive for many of us.
        Affinity has a very good alternative for both Photoshop (Photo), Illustrator (Designer) and InDesign
        (Publisher). Each app costs around € 50 and that is a one-time fee, which also gives you updates. For most
        users, the Affinity apps are full substitutes for Adobe.</p>
      <p>Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer zijn ook beschikbaarare also available op Mac and iPad (separate
        purchases).</p>
      <a class="download" target="blank" href='https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/'>Buy Affinity</a>
      <h3>Social</h3>
      <p>Are you tired of all the separate social apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Skype, Slack and mail? With Franz you
        combine everything in one app and it is free.</p>
      <a class="download" target="blank" href='https://meetfranz.com/'>Download Franz</a>
      <h3>Email</h3>
      <p>BlueMail is one of the better email apps for Windows. The design ensures that you see which actions you can
        perform and just like Outlook it has a calendar function. Where with Outlook the agenda covers the entire
        window, the calendar at BlueMail is shown as a slide-in on the right. This works nice and intuitive. You have a
        dark mode, can add multiple accounts and all other options that you expect from an email app.</p>
      <p>For many people the standard mail app from Windows will work fine, if you want more than Outlook and BlueMail
        are good options.</p>

      <h3>Your Phone: integration with Android phones</h3>
      <p>If you use an Android phone, you can use it on your PC with Your Phone. You view and edit recent images, read
        and send text, see notifications and perform phone calls wity your PC. Apple offers something similar to the
        iPhone in macOS. The iPhone does not (yet) work with Your Phone. This app is part of Windows 10.</p>
      <h3>PWA</h3>
      <p>Many apps are only available as web application. You can open it every time within a browser, but that is not
        great. PWAs (Progressive Web Apps) fix this issue . You still open a PWA within a browser, but if you have
        Chrome or Edge (Chromium) then you can save it as an "app". This works very well for applications such as Google
        Translate, Google Docs and Evernote. Technically, you still work in a browserbut it feels more like an app and
        it has itss own icon on the taskbar.

      <h2>Mac-A-Like en apps that are just useful</h2>
      <p>In recent years, many MacBooks users have made the switch to Windows due to persistent
        problems with the keyboards on MacBooks and because the reliability of both hardware and software in general
        became worse. If you have used macOS for years then it takes some time getting used to Windows and not all apps
        and Mac features are by default available on Windows. With these apps you will make that transition a bit
        easier.</p>
      <h3>Quick look</h3>
      <p>If you select a file, for example an image, in macOS and you tap the space bar then a preview appears. With
        Quicklook you also get that function on Windows.</p>

      <h3>Wox: Alfred for Windows</h3>
      <p>Spotlight and Alfred both boost productivity on the Mac by allowing you to quickly open apps and files or to
        perform tasks. In Windows you can launch apps quickly by pressing the Windows key and then typing the name of
        the app. Wox goes beyond that and does for Windows what Alfred does for macOS. You open apps and files with it,
        but you can also uses it as a calculator. Press Alt + Windows and type what you want to do. Blast is an
        alternative to Wox, but Wox works better.</p>

      <h3>WinXCorners: hot corners</h3>
      <p>On both Linux and Mac you can assign functions to the corners of the screen when you move the mouse to the
        corner. WinXCorners does that for Windows, although is not entirely identical to that of Linux and Mac.</p>

      <h3>ShareX: screenshots</h3>
      <p>Making screen shots on Windows was a drama not too long ago. Luckily Microsoft has improved this feature which
        you can run by using Windows + Shift + S. If you want more than the default option then there is ShareX. With
        ShareX you can easily make and share screen shots. It saves the last made screen shot and you can even set what
        should happen by default after making a screen print.</p>

      <h3>iCloud</h3>
      <p>Apple released an improved version of iCloud for Windows in 2019 in collaboration with Microsoft. The functions
        seem similar to the earlier version with a few new options for syncing files and it just works better. You can
        synchronize bookmarks with Safari, iCloud documents and photos.

    <div class="section" id="security">
      <img src="images/Security.svg" class="delay" data-delay=".2s" alt="door handle with key combination for security">

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>Security is not the strongest point of Windows by default and there are a few things everyone should do. Even
        those who have "nothing to hide",because you don't want some random person to be able to install software that
        follows your activity and sends information about things like making payments.</p>
      <h3>Passwords</h3>
      <p>The first step in security is to ensure that your PC is protected with a strong password. If you don't do this,
        you will leave the door wide open and other security settings will be of little use. A strong password is
        preferably long. Use for example a sentence that you can remember. Of course you shouldn't reuse passwords,
        that's why you might need a password manager so you only have to remember one strong password and the password
        manager takes care of the rest.</p>
      <p>The most popular password managers are available on Windows, macOS, Android and iOS. Two good password managers
        are 1Password and LastPass.</p>
      <a class="download" target="blank" href='https://1password.com/'>Download 1Password</a>
      <a class="download" target="blank" href='https://www.lastpass.com/'>Downsload LastPass</a>
      <h3>Updates</h3>
      <p>Make sure that you install updates. The computer may work well for you, but Updates ensure that security holes
        are solved and that it is less easy for a malicious person break into your PC. Microsoft has improved the
        installation of updates in recent years. You can turn off major updates, which means you have a little more
        control.</p>
      <p>You can change the settings in &gt; <span class="explain">&quot;Settings&quot; &gt;
          &quot;Update & Security&quot; &gt; &quot;Windows update&quot;</span>.</p>
      <h3>Disk encryption</h3>
      <p>A laptop is not protected enough with only a password, because files are still easily accessible because the
        hard disk is not encrypted by default in Windows. Apple has beenoffers FileVault on Macs for disk encryption,
        but you have to enable it yourself. The moment a user doesn't do this then files on a Mac are insufficiently
        protected also.</p>
      <p>Disk encryption on a Windows laptop is is a bit cumbersome compared to a MacBook. Microsoft offers Bitlocker,
        similar to FileVault in macOS, but there is a snag. You have different versions of Windows and Bitlocker is only
        available from Windows Pro and up. Most people at home have Windows Home and have to encrypt the disk in a
        different way. Veracrypt is a good alternative. This is an open source program and works somewhat similar to
        Bitlocker.</p>
      <p>By enabling Bitlocker or Veracrypt, all data on the hard disk is encrypted, which means that they are not or
        difficult accessible for third parties. Another reason why a strong Windows password is important, it affects
        Bitlocker's encryption.</p>
      <p>Bitlocker only works for hardware with a TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip. You can check this on you laptop:
      </p>
      <div class="explain">
        <ul>
          <li>Type Windows key + R (or start PowerShell)</li>
          <li>Type: tpm.msc</li>
          <li>A TPM windows opens. If it says "Compatible TPM cannot be found" then your PC doesn't have a TPM chip.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Windows security and viruses</h3>
      <p>Windows Defender has become a decent alternative for separate anti-virus software such as Norton or McAfee.
        That's great because these programs canhave influence the performance of a
        PC or interfere with other programs. Of course you shouldn't download and install everything.
      </p>
      <p>As a user you get insight into the status of the security in Windows and you can change the settings in
        &quot;Settings&quot; &gt; &quot;Update & Security&quot; &gt; &quot;Windows Security&quot;. In the window that
        opens you see which components require your attentention.
      </p>
      <img class="explain-image" src="images/Windows security.jpg" alt="Windows security overview">
      <p>To make things easier for the user, a number of options, such as a firewall, are turned on by default.</p>
      <h3>Opening files</h3>
      <p>Downloaded files, or received by email, such as PDF, Excel and Word can contain viruses or malware. Therefor it
        is safer to open PDF documents in a <a href='#browser'>browser</a> as Edge or Chrome instead of Adobe Acrobat
        Reader. If you have a Word or Excel document, you can open it in the browser in Google Docs or Sheets.</p>
      <h3>Dynamic lock</h3>
      <p>Lots of people don't lock their laptop when they walk away. This means that someone else can access files,
        install malicious software or make other changes. Locking your PC is easy with the <a href='#shortcuts'>keyboard
          shortcut</a>
        "Windows key + L". Another option is that Windows automatically locks your PC when your phone is no longer in
        the
        around. This increases security without you having to do anything yourself.</p>
      <p>You do this by following these steps:</p>
      <div class="explain">
        <ol>
          <li>Connect a phone or tablet as a bluetooth device to your PC. This is done in:
            &quot;Settings&quot;
            &gt; &quot;Devices&quot; &gt; &quot;Bluetooth & other devices&quot; &gt; tik op &quot;Add bluetooth or other
            device&quot;.</li>
          <li>After connecting the device you go to: &quot;Settings&quot; &gt; &quot;Update & Security&quot; &gt;
            &quot;Windows security&quot; &gt; &quot;Account protection&quot; and select "Dynamic lock".</li>
        </ol>

      <h2>Development</h2>
      <h3>Linux (WSL)</h3>
      <p>Microsoft made a 360 under CEO, Satya Nadella, and that also applies to Windows. The current Microsoft has
        fully embraced Open Source and Linux as where the previous CEO, Steve Ballmer, compared Linux with cancer. These
        days you install Linux as a subsystem on your Windows PC and you can even download different Distros from the
        Windows Store. With the Linux option, Windows has become more attractive for many developers.</p>
      <a class="download" target="blank" href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10'>Linux on
        Windows</a>
      <h3>Package managers</h3>
      <p>Many users (mostly the more technical people and developers) on Linux and macOS use Homebrew as a package
        manager, on Windows you have alternatives such as Scoop or Chocolately. The latter is one of the most popular.
        You install Chocolately with PowerShell. Open PowerShell as administrator and enter:
      </p>
      <p class="explain">"Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object
        System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))"</p>
      <p>If you use WSL, you can also use<a href='https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux'>Homebrew</a> on Windows.</p>
      <h3>Code editors</h3>
      <p>Numerous code editors are available for Windows, including Visual Studio Be a code. There is a good chance that
        you will not have to adjust your workflow or only a little. Xcode is not avalaible.</p>
